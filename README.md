# ml-workflow-for-scones-unlimited-sagemaker

Project for Udacity's ML Nanodegree: Build a ML Workflow For Scones Unlimited On Amazon SageMaker

In this project, you'll be building an image classification model that can automatically detect which kind of vehicle delivery drivers have, in order to route them to the correct loading bay and orders. Assigning delivery professionals who have a bicycle to nearby orders and giving motorcyclists orders that are farther can help Scones Unlimited optimize their operations.

In this project, youâ€™ll use AWS Sagemaker to build an image classification model that can tell bicycles apart from motorcycles. You'll deploy your model, use AWS Lambda functions to build supporting services, and AWS Step Functions to compose your model and services into an event-driven application. At the end of this project, you will have created a portfolio-ready demo that showcases your ability to build and compose scalable, ML-enabled, AWS applications.
